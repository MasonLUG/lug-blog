Easy GMU VPN Connection walkthrough.

## Dependencies
<!-- --protocol=anyconnect -->

* [OpenConnect](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/)

Openconnect can likely be installed by your distributions package manager.

Debian Based:
`sudo apt install openconnect`

Arch Based:
`sudo pacman -S openconnect`

## First use

`openconnect vpn.gmu.edu`

## More Advanced Config

We can also configure this to not require input from us, as well as configure it to be a SystemD service.


### Easier Startup

First lets create a directory for this.

`mkdir gmu-vpn`

and

`cd gmu-vpn`

Lets put this file inside, this will fill in all of the prompts given during the `openconnect` connecting process automatically, and require less intervention from us. 

(Be sure to fill in VPN_USER with your masonlive ID)

`vpn.sh`: 
```
#!/bin/sh

SERVER=vpn.gmu.edu
VPN_USER=
TYPE=STUDENT
PASS_FILE=./.pass_file

cat "$PASS_FILE" | openconnect "$SERVER" -u "$VPN_USER" -g "$TYPE" --passwd-on-stdin -v
```

We'll also need to mark that file as executable so,

`chmod +x ./vpn.sh`

Lastly, we'll need to create a password file, this will store your GMU password, so it's critical that we secure this file. 

`.pass_file`:
```
your-vpn-password-here
```

And we'll want to set that files permissions correctly so other users on your machine can't read it.

`chmod 600 ./.pass_file`

And we're done!

From here you can simply run `./vpn.sh` from inside the `gmu-vpn` directory and be connected.


### SunnyD

But what if you want the bold refreshing taste of SystemD?

Well...


If we create the following file and place it in `/etc/systemd/system`, we'll never have to connect to the vpn manually again!

`gmu-vpn.service`: 
```
[Unit]
Description=GMU VPN
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash ./vpn.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/USER/PATH/TO/gmu-vpn
Type=exec
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


Next we load, enable, and start the service file with the following

`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

`sudo systemctl enable gmu-vpn`

`sudo systemctl start gmu-vpn`


And we're done!
